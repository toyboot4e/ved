# ved — agent context

Electron + React + ProseMirror editor for Japanese vertical writing (tategaki)
with ruby annotations. **Read `docs/architecture.md` before touching the
editor core** (`src/renderer/src/components/editor/`, mainly `editor/pm/`).

- `CONTEXT.md` — project glossary (the words to use, and the ones to avoid).
- `docs/adr/` — architecture decisions and *why* (e.g. browser engine over a
  custom one; the editor framework — Slate → Lexical → **ProseMirror** for the
  rich-syntax roadmap, see ADR-0005 + `docs/prosemirror-migration-plan.md`).

## Commands

Task runner is `just`:

- `just dev` — electron-vite dev server (HMR)
- `just test` — vitest unit tests **and** the full e2e smoke suite (everything);
  `just test <name>` filters to matching unit tests only (fast, no e2e)
- `just check` — biome check --fix (lint + format)
- `just typecheck` — tsc over both node and web tsconfigs
- `just smoke` — builds, then runs the Playwright e2e tests (`test/e2e/`:
  `smoke.ts`, `placeholder.ts` on the shared `harness.ts`; windows stay
  hidden via `VED_SMOKE_HIDDEN`)
- `just test-all` — unit + lint + build + smoke; the definition of done

## Invariants

- **Identity text model.** The document is plaintext: ruby is the one inline
  NODE, and its text content holds the literal markup (`|漢(かん)`), so
  `serialize` (`doc.textBetween(…, '\n')`) is identity-exact, character for
  character. Every other inline format (bold/italic/縦中横, …) is a view-only
  **decoration**, not a node — adding one is a parse rule + a CSS class, no
  structure repair. Never add state where displayed text and model text can
  diverge. Outside the editor core, a document is always a plain string.
  Collapsed markup is hidden with `font-size: 0` (NOT `display: none`) so the
  caret stays addressable; arrow movement skips it via `nextCaretOffset`.
- **Ruby boundaries map to the INSIDE text edge (for a real caret/IME rect).**
  `pm/model.ts offsetToPos` maps a caret at a ruby's start/end to the text
  position just *inside* the node (the edge `|` / `)` leaf), NOT the paragraph
  *element* boundary before/after it. The element boundary has a DEGENERATE
  caret rect (0×0, no adjacent text), so the native caret — and the IME
  composition box — would jump to the viewport's top-left. The inside edge has a
  real rect; typing/IME there still lands *outside* the ruby because the
  structure repair re-parses (e.g. `X` typed at the `|` edge → `X|漢(かん)`,
  re-parsed to plain `X` + ruby). `pm/decorations.ts` uses `buildPosMap` (the
  O(n) batch form of `offsetToPos`, pinned to it by a unit test) so the
  decoration pass isn't O(n²).
- **Keep the caret in view after edits.** PM's `scrollIntoView` doesn't survive
  the post-commit ruby repair (a second transaction) or the vertical-rl
  multi-column page layouts, so `editor.tsx revealCaretInScroller` scrolls the
  caret back into view after every doc change and — synchronously, after the
  re-decoration reflow — on an appear-policy change. It is a no-op when the
  caret is already visible.
- **Caret at ruby boundaries renders via an overlay, not delim font.** At a
  boundary the native caret takes the font-size:0 delimiter's tiny metrics.
  `pm/decorations.ts` flips `rubyActive` (highlight, strictly inside only) and
  `rubyLeadActive`/`rubyTrailActive` (the positions where the native caret is
  invisible — just inside after `|`, before the ruby when nothing visible
  precedes it, and after the collapsed `)`); `pm/ruby.css` hides the native
  caret and draws an absolutely-positioned 1em `::before`. Don't fix caret
  size by expanding the delim's font — it shifts the body. See
  `docs/architecture.md` § "Caret at ruby boundaries".
- **IME safety.** Never repair structure, steal focus, or remount the editor
  during an IME composition (`view.composing`, `event.isComposing`). Ruby
  structure repair (`pm/structure.ts repair`, run from `dispatchTransaction`)
  is skipped while composing. (Real mozc typing is not covered by automation —
  verify by hand when touching this.)
- **Process boundaries.** All fs and dialog access lives in the main process
  behind the typed IPC contract in `src/shared/ipc.ts` (exposed to the
  renderer as `window.ved` by the preload). The renderer never touches Node.
- **Dialog test seams.** Native dialogs cannot be driven by Playwright; main
  accepts stub paths via `VED_SMOKE_*` env vars (see
  `src/main/file-service.ts`). Every new dialog needs such a seam. Ad-hoc
  probe scripts that type text must launch with
  `VED_SMOKE_CLOSE_RESPONSE=discard`, or the close guard wedges the app.
- **TypeScript everywhere.** Standalone scripts (e2e drivers) are `.ts` run
  directly with `node` (Node 24 type stripping) — never `.mjs`.
- **Character counts are ASCII columns.** When a size is given as "N
  characters", it means halfwidth columns: N columns = N/2 fullwidth (全角)
  characters = N/2 em. E.g. the vertical line cap of 80 characters is 40em.

## Current work: editor UI shell

The plan and its living step checklist live in `docs/editor-ui-plan.md`.

Working agreement for this effort:

1. Work proceeds in the numbered steps of the plan, smallest shippable slice
   first. Do exactly one step, then **stop for user review** — do not start
   the next step unasked.
2. Keep shell code decoupled from the editor core: plaintext strings cross
   the boundary, never Lexical values. Prefer new modules over edits to
   existing ones; when an editor-core edit is unavoidable, keep it to a
   minimal, optional surface (e.g. one optional prop).
3. A step is done when `just test-all` passes and the smoke test exercises
   the new behavior end to end. Update the checklist in
   `docs/editor-ui-plan.md` before stopping.
